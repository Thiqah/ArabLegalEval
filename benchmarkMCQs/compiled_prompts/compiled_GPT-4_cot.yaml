      إجابة: '
    rationale: produce the option. We know that human rights are a set of rights that
      are believed to belong justifiably to every person. These rights include the
      right to live freely, to express oneself, and to be treated with equality among
      others. They are fundamental rights which every human being is entitled to have
      protected and respected. The statement suggests that human rights represent
      the voice of human conscience in the social and political field, which aligns
      with the universal concept of human rights being inherent to all human beings,
      regardless of nationality, place of residence, sex, national or ethnic origin,
      color, religion, language, or any other status. Therefore, the statement is
      correct as it emphasizes the role of human rights in reflecting the moral and
      ethical standards of humanity in social and political domains.

      إجابة: '
    rationale: produce the option. The international law for human rights indeed extends
      to provide protection not only for individuals but also for larger groups or
      collectives. This includes various groups such as ethnic minorities, indigenous
      peoples, and other vulnerable groups who are protected under various international
      treaties and declarations. Therefore, the statement in the question is accurate
      as international human rights law does cover the provision of protection for
      both larger groups of individuals and collectives.

    rationale: produce the option. Human rights are indeed global legal guarantees
      that protect individuals and groups from actions that interfere with fundamental
      freedoms and human dignity. These rights are designed to ensure that every person
      is treated with respect and can participate fully in society. They are recognized
      internationally, for example, in documents like the Universal Declaration of
      Human Rights adopted by the United Nations. Therefore, the statement that human
      rights are legal guarantees that protect individuals and groups from governments
      is accurate.

    rationale: produce the option. The question is about the Utilitarian School of
      thought, which believes in maximizing happiness or benefits for the greatest
      number of people. According to this philosophy, it can be justified to sacrifice
      the rights of a certain individual or individuals if it leads to the greater
      good or benefits of the majority. Therefore, the statement aligns with the principles
      of utilitarianism.

    question: 'هذا سؤال قانوني للمحترفين في المغرب. اختر الإجابة الصحيحة!


      سؤال: يقيم الدعوى العمومية:

      A. النيابة العامة

      B. الموظفون المكلفون بذلك قانونا

      C. الطرف المتضرر

      D. جميع الأجوبة صحيحة


      إجابة: '
    rationale: produce the option. We know that the public prosecution (النيابة العامة)
      is typically responsible for initiating public actions in many legal systems,
      including Morocco. This is because their role is to represent the state in prosecuting
      criminal offenses, which aligns with option A. However, it's also true that
      certain officials designated by law (option B) and the injured party (option
      C) can initiate legal actions in specific circumstances. Therefore, considering
      all aspects of the question, it seems that all the given options could be correct
      in different contexts.
